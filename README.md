We'll build an example customer journey for the demo, providing you with practical experience in crafting cohesive and engaging customer experiences. By the end of this session, you will have a deep understanding of how to orchestrate a cohesive and compelling customer journey using these powerful tools, ultimately driving customer satisfaction and engagement.
