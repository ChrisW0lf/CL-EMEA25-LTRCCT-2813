## Task Closed.workflow

The Closed Flow is always executed when an omnichannel conversation is closed by an agent/customer.

You can see in this flow that you can perform additional actions/functions in all three flows. In this case, the complete transcript of the conversation is loaded and stored in JDS as a summary.
